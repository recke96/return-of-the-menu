# Return of the Menu

Since the [Europlaza Website](https://www.europlaza.at/en/restaurants/) does not publish the menu plans anymore (and only annoyingly links to an ad to install their app) we decided to host our own menu plan.

## Tech

Build with [astro](https://astro.build/), which downloads the menus for the day during the build-process to generate a static site styled with [Chota](https://jenil.github.io/chota/).

## Credits

Reverse engineered by [watzek.dev](https://watzek.dev/) built by me.
